          Melbourne is a day ahead. Let me know if there are any issues.{" "}

          There are two final assignments for the course. Final Fall Design
          Reports are due on Nov 26. The contents of your final report will come
          from the revisions of all your assignments. We expect that assignments
          will be updated since your original submission. Included in your
          report should be a Table of Contents, and your report should include a
          README.md page that lists a Table of Contents for all sections of your
          Fall Design Reports.
